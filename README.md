# Onboarding Flow

A two-tab TabView app.<br>
In this app I commited myself to organizing the: 
- (i) `folder structure`,
- (ii) `design enums` (colours and sizes), and
- (iii) `// MARK: -` comments for file sectioning.

> NOTE: This app follows Apple's [Layout and style - Design an interface](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/design-an-interface#Use-a-ZStack-to-embellish-your-graphic) **tutorial**.
